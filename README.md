# ðŸ§© Embeddings Playground

A simple repo to explore how **embeddings** work in practice.  
We go from basic similarity checks to quick semantic search examples, powered by [OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

## ðŸŽ¥ Video

This repository accompanies the YouTube video:  
ðŸ‘‰ [**Embeddings Explained: From Intuition to RAG (with Python demos)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIb1vetJUxw)

In the video we cover:
- Word â†’ vector intuition
- Multilingual embeddings
- Word algebra (`king - man + woman â‰ˆ queen`)
- High-dimensional spaces (2D â†’ hundreds of dimensions)
- Clustering, cosine similarity, and decision boundaries
- Semantic search with FAISS
- RAG pipelines and prompt guardrails
